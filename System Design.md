## Overview
- start by asking you to design a system that performs a given task

## Topics
### Concurrency
- Do you understand threads, deadlock, and starvation? Do you know how to parallelize algorithms? Do you understand consistency and coherence?

### Networking
- Do you roughly understand IPC and TCP/IP? Do you know the difference between throughput and latency, and when each is the relevant factor?

### Abstraction
- You should understand the systems youâ€™re building upon. Do you know roughly how an OS, file system, and database work? Do you know about the various levels of caching in a modern OS?

### Real-World Performance
- You should be familiar with the speed of everything your computer can do, including the relative performance of RAM, disk, SSD and your network.

### Estimation
- Estimation, especially in the form of a back-of-the-envelope calculation, is important because it helps you narrow down the list of possible solutions to only the ones that are feasible. Then you have only a few prototypes or micro-benchmarks to write.

### Availability and Reliability
- Are you thinking about how things can fail, especially in a distributed environment? Do know how to design a system to cope with network failures? Do you understand durability?
