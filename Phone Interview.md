## Phone Interview Steps & Tricks
### Process
- Greeting
	- "Hey! How is it going?! God, i don't even remembr how long I have been working from home，feels like longer than it iactually is." 
	- "I am actually really excited about the interviews, this is the only chance to talk to someone outside of my team and my roommate. (laugh)"
	- "How are things in (interviewer's city)? People start to wear masks and take things serisouly now, hope it will get better soon!"

- the flow
	- Clarifying questions
	- Brainstorm data structures before coding
	- Think of the brute force solution first
	- consider edge cases!!
	- State that you know this is too long / inefficient / blah, state why
	- Now try to improve upon it
	- You can ask for hints if you’re absolutely stuck!

- think out loud, explain your thought process
	- brute force 
	- then optimize it
- "should I start implement it in code, or you want me to continue to optimize it?"
- explain a bit when coding
- explain time complexity
- go through test cases when finished
- follow up on the same coding question
	

### Miscellaneous
	- over communication
		- "Hey, if I look like I am looking to my right/left, that's because my camera is here and I have my codepad opened on another screen"
		- "Hi, if I am silent for a couple secs/mins, I am just thinking about the question"
	- 彩虹屁
		- 吹/dig further when he mentions the challenge/headache in work
		- talk about your potential solutions	
	- don't say anything negative about companies you've worked at !!!!!!

### Red Flags
    - when the interviewer says we're running out of time, "time is up，thank you for your time with us"
    - late
    - "interesting" 可能为敷衍，听烦了
    - "Thank you! (HR) will reach out to you in the next a few day. "  但没有第一人称突显他的行动
    - "I am not sure XXX."
    - "you code seems good..."


### Questions to ask the interviewer
	- Name, job title, maybe email (for reference later on)
	- What made you choose company X?
	- What’s the most satisfying project you’ve worked on?
	- What’s a typical day for an intern like?
	- Any example projects interns have worked on?
	- What’s your favorite thing about working for your company?
	- How does this company compare to other places you’ve worked before?
	- what's a typical day like (if care about work-life balance)
	- What is your most challenging part in your daily work?.
	- what do you expect from a new hire/intern of my level in the fist half year?
	- what’s the most unique part about working at xxx that you’ve never experienced before.
