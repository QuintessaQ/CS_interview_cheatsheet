## Phone Interview Steps & Tricks
- Greetings
	- "Hey! How is it going?! God, i don't even remembr how long I have been working from home，feels like longer than it iactually is." 
	- "I am actually really excited about the interviews, this is the only chance to talk to someone outside of my team and my roommate. (laugh)"
	- "How are things in (interviewer's city)? People starts to wear makses and take things serisouly now, hope it gets better soon!"
- think out loud, explain your thought process
	- brute force 
	- then optimize it
- "should I start implement it in code, or you want me to conitnue to optimize it?"
- explain a bit when coding
- explain time complexity
- go through test cases when finished
- follow up on the same coding question
	

- Miscellaneous
	- over communication
		- "Hey, if I look like I am looking to my right/left, that's because my camera is here and I have my codepad opened on another screen"
		- "Hi, if I am silent for a couple secs/mins, I am just thinking through the question"
	- 彩虹屁
		- 吹/dig further when he mentions the challenge/headache in work
		- talk about your potential solutions	

- Red Flags
    - when the interviewer says we're running out of time, "time is up，thank you for your time with us"
    - late
    - "interesting" 可能为敷衍，听烦了
    - "Thank you! (HR) will reach out to you in the next a few day. "  但没有第一人称突显他的行动
    - "I am not sure XXX."
    - "you code seems good..."
