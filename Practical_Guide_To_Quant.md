## Chapter 2 Brain Teasers
- starts with a simplified version
### Screwy pirates
- 100 coins divided to 5 pirates
- 2 pirates, a and b
    - b proposes: b gets 100, a gets 0
- 3 pirates, a, b, c
    - a will supports c no matter what
    - a: 1, b: 0, c: 99
- 4 pirates, abcd
    - b supports d
    - a: 0, b: 1, c: 0, d: 99
- 5 pirates, abcde
    - a: 1, b: 0, c: 1, d: 0, e: 98

### Tiger and sheep
- 1 tiger, 1 sheep
    - eat
- 2 tigers, ab
    - not eat
- 3 tigers, abc
    - a eats
- 4 tigers, abcd
    - if a eats, then 2 sheep, bcd
        - if b eats, then 3 sheep, cd
            - not eating then
    - a won't eat

### River crossing
- CD cross, D back, 3min
- AB cross, C back, 2
- CD cross, 2min


### Card game
- 2 cards

### Defective ball
- 4 + 4 + 4

### Horse race
- 5 groups, 5 races, have orderibg in each group
- pick tops from each group, 1 race, then 3 groups have potential answers, 3+2+1 candidates
- race  1,2,3,6,7, then add 11 and race 

## Chapter 4 Probablity Theory
### Coin toss game
- remove one coin from A
- E1: A more coins
- E2: equal coins
- E3: A fewer coins
- P(E1) = P(E2) = x, then 2x + y = 1
- result = x + y/2 = 0.5
